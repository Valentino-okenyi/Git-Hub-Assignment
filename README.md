# Explain Version Control.
 Version control also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing any change to software codes. It tracks the progress of a code across its developments and iterations.

# Explain the difference between Git and Github.
Git is an open source version control tool that tracks code changes locally often lacking collaboration tools.<br>
While Github is a microsoft owned platform to host git repositories, it shares and collaborates online requiring internet to access repositories.

-Git pull- however reteieves updates and integrate them into your local branch, it can be used when you want to update your local branch immediately with changes from the remote repository.
